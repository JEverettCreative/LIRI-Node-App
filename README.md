## LIRI-Node-App
LIRI is a CLI utilizing Node.js to execute different functions depending on user input; each command pulls data from a different API (Spotify, Bands in Town, OMDB).

## Contributors

## Technology
* Node.js, GitBash, Spotify NPM, Axios. 

## About
* LIRI allows a user to input a combination of a specific pre-defined command type (i.e. 'spotify-this') and a search term. The command type is chosen in the index 2 point of the CLI command, and the search term is comprised of anything typed in the index 3 and beyond. Each command pulls from a different API (Spotify, Bands in Town, or OMDB) to return information to the user. Another command, 'do-what-it-says', executes whatever command and search term are in the random.txt file, which could be edited by the user, so long as they maintain the format of 'command,search term.'  

## How-to use this code
* Files could be pulled and run through GitBash once installed on your machine. Screenshot examples are further below on this Readme.
